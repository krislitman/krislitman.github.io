I"D<p>In my last post I set up a background job implementation in a Rails application, you can read that <a href="https://krislitman.github.io/background-jobs-rails/">here</a>. For testing these changes, we will need to make adjustments to the User model, and add in a new test for the UserLogCreateJob class.</p>

<h3 id="user-model-test">User Model Test</h3>

<p>Since the addition of a callback method in the user model (after_create), the test will need to account for enqueuing a job once a new user is created. First add the rspec-rails gem to the Gemfile, afterwards be sure to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code>.</p>

<p><strong>In Progress</strong></p>
